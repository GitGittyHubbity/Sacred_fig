Of the over 800 species in the genera *Ficus*[^1] , *Ficus religiosa* is likely among the most famous. *F. religiosa*, commonly known as the sacred fig or the bodhi tree, is a fig native to the Indian subcontinent, east Himalaya, Myanmar, and Malayan region.  The epithet, religiosa, alludes to its significance to Hinduism and Buddhism, two major religions also originating from the Indian subcontinent.[^2] Though the name *Ficus religiosa* was first designated by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, the species was later given eight other scientific names by subsequent taxonomists. These include *Ficus peepul* and *Urostigma affine*.[^3]  Paralleling its nomenclative popularity in the scientific world, *F. religiosa* also bears over 150 known vernacular names.[^4][^5] Table 1. illustrates some of the names in the various languages spoken in India alone. Common names today include the bodhi tree, peepal tree and the *Ashvattha* tree.[^6] This richness in vernacular names reflects the species’ cultural importance and rich history.

## The Hindu King of Trees:
The sacred fig’s religious significance spans thousands of years, likely beginning as early as the conception of Hinduism in the 15th to 20th century BC. Its association with Hindu deities can be traced back to ancient scriptures, where it is referred to as *Ashvatta*, or King of Trees.[^7] Lord Krishna not only compared himself to the *Ashvattha* in the *Bhagavad Gita*, but was also said to assume the physical form of the tree.[^8] [^9] Consequently, the tree was highly revered as a vessel of divine power and sacredness. Harming the peepal tree was said to bring ill-fortune, while worshipping the tree brought one closer to spiritual liberation.[^10]

The tree’s religious significance is also closely tied to its medicinal properties, which are often referenced in holy texts.[^11] The use of medicinal plants such as the peepal tree have been central to Indian medicine, or Ayurveda, for centuries.[^12] Being deeply tied to Hinduism, Ayurveda eventually spread, along with the religion, throughout Southeast Asia, including Singapore, and is still widely practised today.[^13] [^14] According to the discipline, every part of the peepal tree has medicinal value.[^15] Its leaves, bark, and fruits are used to treat various ailments from asthma to arthritis.[^16] Modern pharmacological research has confirmed the curative properties of various compounds present within different parts of the tree.[^17] [^18] Particularly in rural areas where modern medical aid is not readily available, F. religiosa remains an important curative to support the health of locals.[^19]

## A Path to Nirvana:
Around the fifth century BC, Siddartha Guatama founded Buddhism in modern day India near the present Nepalese border.[^20] Though there is contention whether Buddhism can be considered an offshoot of ancient Hinduism, the two religions undoubtedly share one common feature: their reverence for F. religiosa.[^21] In fact, the tree features prominently in Buddhist lore, being the tree under which Siddartha Guatama achieved enlightenment, or ‘bodhi’ and attained nirvana. It is likely during the rise of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent, that the now widely used moniker, bodhi tree, became adopted. From ancient history, to the modern day, F. religiosa’s association with Buddhist enlightenment afforded it veneration and inspired much worship. 

In 288 BC, King Ashoka, who ruled over Bodh Gaya (where Buddha’s Tree of Enlightenment originally stood), delivered a branch of the Tree as a peace offering to Sri Lanka, where Buddhism had newly established.[^22] This branch was planted in Anuradhapura, where it eventually grew in the Jaya Maha Bodhi, likely the most sacred individual tree in Buddhism today. This title would have been afforded to the original Tree of Enlightenment in Bodh Gaya were it not for the tragedy that occurred in 245 BC. Ashoka’s queen, Tissarakkha, grew jealous of her husband’s devotion to the Tree of Enlightenment and reportedly destroyed the tree using a poisonous thorn.[^23] Distraught, Ashoka transplanted a cutting from the Jaya Maha Bodhi onto the spot where the Tree of Enlightenment once stood, in essence reviving the tree.[^24] Aside from Bodh Gaya, many temples around the world also have F. religiosa shoots believed to be the direct offspring of the sacred tree in Anuradhapura.[^25] 

Practitioners of Buddhism would propagate F. religiosa in places of worship or simply cultivate it for its connection to the Buddha. Thus, as Buddhism spread throughout the rest of Asia, so did the venerated plant.[^26] Among buddhists in China, the sacredness of F. religiosa inspired the use of its leaves in religious art and scripture.[^27] The dried heart-shaped leaves of the plant would act as canvases for pigment or ink to be applied for the painting of religious depictions or the writing of sutras .[^28] Most often, the paintings include illustrations of great Buddhist sages, or arhats, while writings frequently transcribe the Heart Sutra, a seminal piece of Mahāyāna wisdom.[^29] This practice extends to the modern day, and such keepsakes can be purchased at various Buddhist temples and shrines around the world.[^30]

The religious importance of the bodhi tree to Buddhism still facilitates its propagation and spread around the world in the modern day. In August 2021, Australia imported an offspring of the Anuradhapura tree with the goal of planting it in a Buddhist temple.[^31] Despite the nation’s arduous extensive biosecurity measures, requiring the sapling to undergo a year-long quarantine and thorough examination for potential flora pathogens, the religious and cultural importance of the tree saw adequate impetus for its transplantation.[^32]

## A Singaporean Natural and Cultural Heritage:
Followers of Buddhism and Hinduism collectively comprise over 35% of the population in Singapore and F. religiosa features prominently alongside the various temples or roadside shrines of its associated faiths.[^33] The oldest bodhi tree in Singapore is probably the located on Lorong How Sun. Towering at 30 meters tall, the over 100-year-old tree was housed in the ex-premises of the Jin Long Si Temple.[^34] [^35] The temple premises was acquired by the government in 2003 for urban redevelopment, sparking appeals to save the temple, and the historically and religiously significant tree.[^36] Though the appeals ultimately failed to preserve the temple, the bodhi tree was saved and authorities made commitments to protect the tree.[^37] Now, the tree holds vigil over its new surroundings, with the wooden-walled, zinc-roofed temple of the past replaced by high-rise condominiums.[^38]

To acknowledge and celebrate the significance of mature trees like the one at Lorong How Sun, government authority Nparks launched the Heritage Tree Scheme in 2001.[^39] The initiative designates trees that have particular historical, social, cultural or aesthetic value as Heritage Trees, affording them, and certain aspects of their immediate environment, conservation protection. Of the 262 registered Heritage Trees, five of them are F. religiosa. As part of the citizen appeals to save Jin Long Si Temple and its resident bodhi tree, supporters nominated the tree for Heritage Tree status, hoping that the conservation status attached to the title would safeguard both the temple and the tree against urban redevelopment. Though the nomination evidently failed, the attention brought to the tree was pivotal to its continued survival into the modern day.[^40]

Aside from integrating to the religious and cultural landscape of the small nation, the adaptable and generalist plant has also naturalised into Singapore's vegetation, becoming an important feature of local ecosystems. Its fruits sustain the diet of a variety of birds and mammals such as the pied oriental hornbill, Asian koel and the variable squirrel.[^41] When germinating, F. religiosa can develop as an epiphyte, clinging onto the surfaces of other trees, walls or crevices. Host trees harbouring F. religiosa eventually get enveloped and strangled by the epiphyte’s aerial roots. F. religiosa also has an ecological quirk. Like most fig species, it is entirely dependent on a specific species of fig wasp for pollination. For F. religiosa, this is Platyscapa quadraticeps, which is specialised to crawl into the fruits of the tree which, in turn, have receptacles that are uniquely and ideally shaped for the female wasps to lay their eggs.[^42] This mutualism is so specific that neither species can survive without the other, even in the presence of other wasp or fig species.

Ficus religiosa, the Ashvattha or bodhi tree, stands as a remarkable symbol of religious and cultural significance. Its roots stretch into the ancient history of Hinduism and Buddhism, where it is revered as a vessel of divine power and enlightenment. The tree's association with medicinal properties has also made it an integral part of traditional healing practices. Today, Ficus religiosa continues to inspire awe and devotion, with its propagation and conservation efforts reflecting the deep-rooted connections between humanity, spirituality, and the natural world.

For reference, first open the [Juncture user guide](https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/juncture/wiki/visual-essay-tags) in a new tab. Then, go ahead and enter your essay title in the "title" field above, and your name as you'd like it to appear in "author". For the banner image, you can pick anything you already have permissions to use. The image will be automatically scaled to fit the field (or you can crop/create an image 1200 by 400 pixels).

## This is a quick Markdown tutorial. Two hashes precede a heading. You can use these headings to divide sections of your essay.

*This makes things italics*. 

This is how you add a footnote. [^1]

[This is how you add a link](https://www.juncture-digital.org/KatherineMEnright/speciesstories/)

This is how you add a mouse-over information panel from Wiki data: <span eid="Q170662">Mangosteen</span>
You can find the wikidata IDs by searching for proper nouns [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). The ID is the series of digits following the letter Q.

**There's no spell-check feature built in, so keep a careful eye out!**

## Adding Images
       
You can use the QID tag within a sentence. For example: The <span eid="Q170662">mangosteen</span> is a non-native fruit found in Singapore. This is the code you use to add an image. Make sure to **close the tag**. It starts with **<param ve-image** and ends with a closing **>**. Within these tags, you can add information to help the program locate and describe the image. **While these examples are images, we can also include textual sources (particularly primary sources) in the media viewer where appropriate.**
<param ve-image 
       url="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/V0044770/full/1338%2C/0/default.jpg"
       title="Mangosteen Photograph" 
       description="A mangosteen plant (Garcinia mangostana): fruiting branch and halved fruit. Photograph. Wellcome Collection.">
       
<span eid="Q271648">Marianne North</span> painted this painting of a 'Singapore monkey' amongst mangosteen fruits in 1875. You can also include "attribution" in the image information.
<param ve-image 
       url="https://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w1200h1200/collection/LSW/RBGM/LSW_RBGM_MN_CD6_577-001.jpg"
       title="Flowers and Fruit of the Mangosteen, and a Singapore Monkey" 
       description="Held by Kew Gardens."
       attribution="Marianne North"
       license="CC BY-NC">
       
These are both examples of images added *from urls*. This is the preferred method. However, there might be some images you have to upload yourself. That's totally fine! Ideally, these files should be *as small as possible* and only .jpg or .png files will work. You should create a folder in your repository called "media" and upload the file there. Then, for the url, just copy and paste the item path: "media/{filename}.jpg". For more information on adding multiple images, comparisons, curtain sliders, and for how to zoom into particular sections of an image, check out the documentation [here](https://github.com/JSTOR-Labs/juncture/wiki/Visual-Essay-Image-Tag).

## Map

Mangosteens are found in Singapore. This takes a base map and sets the center to Singapore. The code after creates markers for different species, for instance, or to mark particular places on a map.
<param ve-map center="1.35, 103.9" zoom="11">
<param ve-map-marker
       url="https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-green.png"
       coords="1.3621, 103.8198"
       size="38, 95"
       iconAnchor="22, 94"
       shadowUrl="https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-shadow.png"
       shadowSize="50, 64">
<param ve-map-marker
url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Pinz%C3%B3n_azul_de_Gran_Canaria_%28macho%29%2C_M._A._Pe%C3%B1a.jpg/220px-Pinz%C3%B3n_azul_de_Gran_Canaria_%28macho%29%2C_M._A._Pe%C3%B1a.jpg"
       coords="1.4126, 103.9577"
       size="129, 170"
       circle="true">
    
    
You can create custom regions just by drawing shapes (no coding needed) using [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20). Then you can download the shape file and add it to your juncture media file as a map layer. Let's imagine this is the distribution range of your species.

<param ve-map center="1.35, 103.9" zoom="2">
<param ve-map-layer geojson url="/media/demomap.geojson" title="Sample Distribution"> 

## Add a YouTube Video
You can take the id from the YouTube URL. You can also define the start time with start="0:20" (for instance).
<param ve-video id="5upF4rJUxC4" title="NYBG 2019 Corpse Flower Timelapse">

## Add a Timeline
This uses the [Knightlab platform](https://timeline.knightlab.com/). The back-end, for you to use, will just be a googlesheets (so it's user friendly!). Here's an example:
<param ve-knightlab-timeline source="1T9E8QZRT7ZFFmb55uLpJUSnELKuqSsXlLmNuVXvOC_I" timenav-position="bottom" hash-bookmark="false" initial-zoom="1" height="640">


## Multiple viewers

Multiple viewers may be defined for a single paragraph of text.  The first viewer defined is displayed as the default viewer.  
Others are selectable using icons displayed in the top right margin of the paragraph.
<param ve-image 
       url="https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/image/V0044770/full/1338%2C/0/default.jpg"
